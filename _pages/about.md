![Ratio](/images/ratio.png)
The ratio of the percent distribution of COVID Deaths among the non-white population to the propotion of the population that is not white. Ratios larger than 1, represented in red, indicate areas where the non-white population is harder hit by COVID deaths. Ratios smaller than 1, represented in blue, indicate areas where the white population is harder hit by COVID deaths. Areas in black represent counties with no significant racial disparity in COVID deaths. The giant swath of dark grey indicates areas with too few deaths of minorities to allow for subsetting on the county level. Areas in white represent stupid counties that don't have the decency to conform to a format conducive to easy data sanitization.
